## The project
This is an ASP.NET Core project for my final module studying towards a BSc(Hons) Computer Science. It will be a 'simple' Service Management tool bespoke to the requirements of my organisation.

This application will ultimately start my portfolio of ASP.NET products of which I intend to seek future employment, either as a .NET developer or as a solutions/software architect. 

In combination with the final report, this project seeks to showcase not only my skills as a .net developer, but also that of a solutions architect.

This application is being built with limited knowledge of the .NET workflow, I have experience in C# and the Unity 6 APIs where my hobby is video game development. This was the driver for me continuing with C# - as I am aiming to focus my knowledge in one area.
