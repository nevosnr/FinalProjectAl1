<hr>

## The project
This ASP.NET project was initially concieved to complete the requirements of the final project module of 
the BSc (Hons) in Computer Science I am currently (Spring/Summer 2025) completing with Hertfordshire University.

It has the purpose of both fulfilling the module requirements and will have a professional requirement for my current organisation.

To that end, the submission will in effect be a MVP of the organisational requirement and below there will be details on the developmental roadmap for this application.
